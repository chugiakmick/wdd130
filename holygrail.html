            <h2>Permaculture Basic Description</h2>
            <p>Permaculture is basically a philosophy of working with nature rather than trying to impose your own
                order.<br>
                This is done by picking plants and animals that will create a small ecosystem within the larger, local
                and regional ecosystem.<br>
                We do this by filling as many ecological niches as possible with species of our own choosing that will
                produce products or services we want, <br>
                or support the production of products we want.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>EXAMPLE: Chickens in a mixed orchard</h2>
            <P>A very simple example might be putting chickens and geese in a mixed fruit orchard. The fruit trees
                provide a product (fruit) and shade to protect the ground, <br>
                while the chickens provide several products or services such as pest control, automatically applied
                fertilizer, weed control, cleaning up fallen fruit, eggs and meat.<br>
                Of course these things need to be balanced. A single chicken in an huge orchard would not provide
                enough,while a million chickens around three trees would provide far to much fertilizer <br>
                and would become a detrimental force in the orchard. <br>
                This is in keeping with the Lords command to Adam to care for the Garden in which he was placed.</P>
